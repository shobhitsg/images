| Metric | Serializable Isolation | Repeatable Read Isolation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Read lock acquired | Yes (blocks concurrent writes) | No |
| Transaction wait time | High (transactions queue behind reads) | Minimal (only at commit time to acquire exclusive locks for writes) |
| System throughput | Throttled by lock contention | Maximized |
